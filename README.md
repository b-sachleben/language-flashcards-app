# Language Learning App

### Final Project,
### Code Louisville January 2018 session

---

This is a Node.js project using MongoDb to persist data.  The intent of the project is to create a system of flashcards so the user can quiz oneself on foreign language words, with the example being in Japanese.  The user can add cards, edit them, delete them, view a list of all of them, and view the details of one card.  In this way, the user can create their own quiz to test their knowledge.
