###Language Learning App

##Final Project,
##Code Lousville January 2018 session

This is a Node.js project using MongoDb to persist data.  The intent of the project is to create a system of flashcards so the user can quiz oneself on foreign language words, with the example being in Japanese.  The user can add cards, edit them, delete them, view a list of all of them, and view the details of one card.  In this way, the user can create their own quiz to test their knowledge.

To view this app, download from Github and do the following:

    * Go to root directory of project
    * Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
    * __Make sure there is an internet connection because, though it can be run by your local machine, the project is dependent on resources sourced from the internet__
    * Run ‘nodemon’ to begin the app server process
    * Open a browser window and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
